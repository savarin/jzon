# jzon Development Logs

This directory contains detailed session logs documenting the development process, decisions, and milestones achieved during jzon's implementation.

## Log File Naming Convention

Log files should follow this naming pattern:
```
YYYYMMDD-HHMM-brief-milestone-summary.md
```

**Examples:**
- `20250122-1900-state-machine-architecture-milestone.md`
- `20250123-1400-zig-integration-planning-session.md`
- `20250124-1000-json-spec-compliance-completion.md`

**Guidelines:**
- Use dashes (`-`) not underscores (`_`) in filenames
- Keep the summary brief but descriptive (3-5 words)
- Use 24-hour time format in Pacific Time
- Always use `.md` extension for markdown formatting

## Required Log Content Structure

Each log file should contain a comprehensive record of the development session, approaching maximum detail length. The structure should include:

### 1. Session Header
```markdown
# jzon Development Log - [Milestone Name]
**Session**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Milestone**: Brief description of main achievement
```

### 2. Executive Summary
A concise overview of the session's key accomplishments and outcomes.

### 3. Detailed Chronological Overview
A comprehensive, step-by-step account including:
- **Specific examples and code snippets** discussed
- **Direct quotes** from conversations, especially user feedback
- **Framework and library references** (Newtonsoft.Json, Pydantic, FastAPI, etc.)
- **Technical concepts and terminology** established
- **Decision points and rationale** for chosen approaches

### 4. Technical Architecture Summary
Document all technical details:
- **Code structures and patterns** implemented
- **Type system decisions** and their justification
- **Performance considerations** and optimization strategies
- **Error handling approaches** and validation methods
- **Integration patterns** with external tools/frameworks

### 5. Context and Background Information
Preserve all established context:
- **Prior work and architectural decisions** that influenced current session
- **Requirements and constraints** identified
- **Design principles and methodologies** agreed upon
- **Quality standards and testing approaches** established

### 6. Implementation Details
Record specific technical implementations:
- **Code snippets and examples** of key functionality
- **Configuration and setup details** for development environment
- **Testing strategies and validation approaches** used
- **Documentation and communication patterns** established

### 7. Current Status and Future Directions
- **Completed milestones** with verification criteria
- **Open questions and unresolved issues** identified
- **Potential implementation challenges** and proposed solutions
- **Next logical steps** in the development process
- **Long-term strategic considerations** for the project

### 8. Methodologies and Patterns
Document agreed-upon approaches:
- **Development methodologies** (TDD, type-safety first, etc.)
- **Code quality standards** and enforcement mechanisms
- **Documentation practices** and maintenance strategies
- **Collaboration patterns** that proved effective

### 9. Lessons Learned and Conclusions
Capture insights and strategic positioning:
- **Key insights** gained during the session
- **Strategic advantages** achieved through architectural decisions
- **Development velocity patterns** that proved effective
- **Quality assurance practices** that maintained standards

## Purpose and Usage

These logs serve multiple purposes:

### Historical Record
- **Complete development history** with full context preservation
- **Decision rationale documentation** for future reference
- **Technical debt and architectural decision tracking**

### Knowledge Transfer
- **Onboarding documentation** for new contributors
- **Context restoration** for resumed development sessions
- **Best practices documentation** and pattern libraries

### Project Management
- **Milestone tracking** and progress measurement
- **Risk identification** and mitigation strategies
- **Resource allocation** and priority setting

### Quality Assurance
- **Verification criteria** for completed work
- **Testing strategy documentation** and coverage analysis
- **Performance benchmark** and optimization tracking

## Writing Guidelines

### Depth and Detail
- Approach maximum output length for comprehensive coverage
- Include specific technical details, not just high-level summaries
- Preserve exact quotes and specific examples wherever possible
- Document both successful approaches and challenges encountered

### Technical Accuracy
- Include actual code snippets and configuration examples
- Document exact tool versions, commands, and environment details
- Preserve error messages and their resolution approaches
- Record performance metrics and benchmark results where applicable

### Context Preservation
- Explain the reasoning behind technical decisions
- Document alternative approaches considered and why they were rejected
- Include relevant background information and prior work references
- Maintain connections between related concepts and implementations

### Future Utility
- Write for developers who might work on the project months later
- Include enough detail to fully reconstruct the development state
- Document both explicit decisions and implicit assumptions
- Provide clear pathways for continued development

## Maintenance

- Review logs periodically for accuracy and completeness
- Update this README when naming conventions or structure requirements change
- Cross-reference related sessions and maintain consistency in terminology
- Archive or reorganize logs as the project grows to maintain navigability
